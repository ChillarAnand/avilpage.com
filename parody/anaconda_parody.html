    <p>My Anaconda don't, my Anaconda don't
My Anaconda don't want none unless you've got code, bro</p>
<p>Boy named Troy used to code in Detroit
Big, big, big projects, he was getting some cheques</p>
<p>Was in conflicts with the packages, but he lived in a palace
Bought me Jupyter notebooks, he was keeping me productive
Now that's real, real, real</p>
<p>One in my IDE, 'cause I came prepared to code
Who wants to go first? I had 'em running on servers
I'm fly as hell, I got 'em thirsty, machine learning
I'm on some deep learning -</p>
<p>By the way, what does he say?</p>
<p>He can tell I ain't missing no installs
Come through and check him in my virtual environment</p>
<p>Let him - with his GPUs, he keep telling me to chill
He keeps telling me it's real, that he knows my coding skills</p>
<p>He says don't like 'em slow, he want something he can run fast
So I pulled up pypy in prod, and I hit him with the code like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun</p>
<p>My Anaconda don't, my Anaconda don't
My Anaconda don't want none unless you've got code, bro</p>
<p>Holy shit, look at his code
Holy shit, look at his code
Holy shit, look at his code
(Look at his code)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at his code</p>
<p>This-This dude named Alex used to code in Python
It's bigger than a petabyte, I ain't talking about small
Real AI Anaconda, let me run with his TensorFlow
P-P-Put his code to sleep, now he's calling me PyTorch
Now that neural network, neural network
I let him run it 'cause he's hungry, hungry, hungry
All in his - like his name Romaine
And when we're done, I make him buy me a GPU</p>
<p>I'm on some deep learning -
By the way, what does he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and check him in my virtual environment
Let him - with his GPUs, he keep telling me to chill
He keeps telling me it's real, that he know my coding skills
He says don't like 'em slow, he wants something he can run fast</p>
<p>So I pulled up in the cloud, and I hit him with the code like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun
My Anaconda don't, my Anaconda don't
My Anaconda don't want none unless you've got code, bro
Oh my gosh, look at his code
Oh my gosh, look at his code
Oh my gosh, look at his code
(Look at his code)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at his code
Little in the middle but he's got much back-end
Little in the middle but he's got much back-end
Little in the middle but he's got much back-end
(Oh my God, look at his code)
My Anaconda don't, my Anaconda don't
My Anaconda don't want none unless you've got code, bro
Don't, my Anaconda don't
Don't want none unless you've got code, bro
Oh my gosh, look at his code
Oh my gosh, look at his code
Oh my gosh, look at his code
(Look at his code)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at his code
Yeah, he loves this fat algorithm, hahaha!
Yeah, this one is for my bro with a fat model in the M- club
I said, where my fat algorithm big model in the M- club?
F- the slow algorithms, f- the slow algorithms in the M- club
I wanna see all the fast fat algorithms model in the M- club
F- you if you inefficient, what? Kyuh
Haha, haha, rrrrrrr
Yeah, I got a big fat-
Come on
Hey
Hey
Hey</p>
