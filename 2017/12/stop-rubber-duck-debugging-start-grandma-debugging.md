One fine morning, I got stuck in finding a critical bug. Unable to figure out the isue, I decided to try rubber duck debugging.

For that I need a rubber duck. I searched entire home and asked couple of neighbours also but couldnt find a rubber duck. So I hit the stores, bought a rubber duck and returned home.

With the duck in hand, I sat again to fix the issue. As I started to explain the duck about the problem, I realized that the duck doesn't know Python or english or any human language infact.
