        <hr>
<div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p><a href="http://mybmtc.com" target="_blank">BMTC</a> (Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation) is a government agency which operates the public transport bus service in Bangalore, India. It holds monopoly as it is the only choice for public transportation.</p>
<h3>Fare Calculation</h3>
<p>BMTC considers ~2KM distance as a stage and the <a href="https://www.mybmtc.com/general-service?fareid=gns&amp;qt-home_quick_tab_bottom=2" target="_blank">fares for each stage</a> are as follows.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../bmtc-fare-charges.png" width="600px"></p>

<p>Let's say, you want to travel from Indira Nagar to BTM Layout, it will cover 5 stages. So, BMTC charges 19₹ for that.</p>
<h3>Exploitation?</h3>
<p>If you travel from Indira Nagar KFC signal to Doopanahalli Arch(1.2KM), which comes under 1 stage, you have to pay 5₹.  On the other hand, if you travel Indira Nagar KFC signal to Doopanahalli bustop(1.4KM), you have to pay 12₹.</p>
<p>How can BMTC charge 5₹ for the first 1.2KM and 7₹ for the subsequent 0.2KM?  If BMTC charges, 5₹ for 1st stage. Then it should charge 5₹ + extra for next stage. But it shouldn't be more than 10₹.</p>
<p>You can just take 1 ticket(5₹) for 1st stage(1.2KM) and one more ticket(5₹)  for the next stage(0.2KM).  You can just travel 2 stages with 2 tickets for 10₹.</p>
<p>Turnsout BMTC is charging 3₹ extra on every ticket which covers atleast 2 stages.  As lakhs of people travel in BMTC buses daily, in a month, this 3₹ turns into crores of rupees.</p>
<p>I am not sure when BMTC has started charging like this. A month back, I sent them an email asking for an explaination of unfair bus tickets and they haven't replied yet.</p>

        <hr>
<div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p>Django developers decided to <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23919" target="_blank">drop Python 2 compatability</a> in Django 2.0. There are serveral things that should be refactored/removed.</p>
<p>For example, in Python 2, programmers has to explicitly specify the class &amp; instance when invoking <code>super</code>.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__init__</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>In Python 3, <code>super</code> can be invoked without arguments and it will choose right class &amp; instance automatically.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__init__</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>For this refactoring, a simple <code>sed</code> search/replace should suffice. But, there are several hacks in codebase where super calls the grandparent instead of the parent. So, <code>sed</code> won't work in such cases. Also it is very hard to refactor them manually and much harder for reviewers to review it as there are 1364 super calls in code base.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>→ grep -rI <span class="s2">"super("</span> <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
   1364
</pre>


<p>Changes has to be scripted. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ChillarAnand/01/blob/master/python/super_exp.py" target="_blank">simple script</a> to replace super calls by class names. This worked only for 50% of the cases. It failed to capture classes which had comments on top of them, classes with decorators and nested classes.</p>
<p>To handle all these cases, a normal python script gets more complicated and there is no guarantee that it can handle all edge cases. So, I experimented with AST(Abstract Syntax Trees).</p>
<p>Python has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" target="_blank">ast module</a> to convert code to AST but it can't convert AST back to code. There are 3rd party packages like <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/astor" target="_blank">astor</a> which can do this.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="c1"># this is a comment</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">():</span>

   <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="s2">"hello world"</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>Converting above code to AST and then converting back gives this</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>Code to AST is a lossy transformation as they cannot preserve empty lines, comments and code formatting.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">ast_to_code</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">code_to_ast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_code</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">source_code</span>
</pre>


<p>For lossless transformation, FST(Full Syntax Trees) packages like <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/baron" target="_blank">Baron</a> or <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/redbaron" target="_blank">RedBaron</a> should be used.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">fst_to_code</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">code_to_fst</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_code</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">source_code</span>
</pre>


<p>With RedBaron FST, just locate super calls, find nearest class node, check class name with super and replace accordingly. It took <a href="https://github.com/ChillarAnand/01/blob/master/python/redbaron_super.py" target="_blank">less than 10 lines</a> of code.</p>
<p>RedBaron has good documentation with relveant examples and its API is similar to BeautifulSoup. Next time when writing code that modifies code consider using RedBaron.</p>

        <hr>
<div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p>Titus Brown wrote a blog post on why <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-top-ten-reasons-blog-posts.html">blog posts are better than scientific papers</a>. Here are few more reasons for that.</p>
<h3>Fast</h3>
<p>Publishing blog posts is lightning fast(how fast can you type?). You can just publish it with a click after writing. However with scientific papers you have to wait months to get your work published.</p>
<h3>Mutability</h3>
<p>Blog posts are easy to edit. If you are using a version controlled system like git, any one can easily collaborate. You can also leave comments on (most) blog posts and can have discussion with the author and/or others. Scientific papers once published are hard to change.</p>
<h3>No Gatekeepers</h3>
<p>To publish blog posts, you can setup your own blog or use services like <a href="http://medium.com">medium</a>. There are no gatekeepers who says that you can't publish a blog post because they thinks its not worth it.</p>
<h3>Organic</h3>
<p>Blog posts tend to be casual and organic. You can crack a joke and readers will enjoy it. Scientific papers are formal. You spray some sarcasm and your paper never gets published.</p>
