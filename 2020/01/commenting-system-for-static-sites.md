### Introduction

This site [AvilPage][] is generated by [Nikola][], a static site generator. Since this is a static site, to setup up comments it has to depend on hosted commenting systems like
<a href='https://disqus.com' rel='nofollow'>Disqus</a>,
<a href='https://just-comments.com' rel='nofollow'>JustComments</a>
etc or self-host an open source system like
[Coral][],
[StaticMan][],
[Isso][] etc.


### Open Source Alternatives

Initially I have setup disqus comments on this blog.
