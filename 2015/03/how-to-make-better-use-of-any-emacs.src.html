      <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy" target="_blank">Elpy</a> is an Emacs package that brings powerful Python editing to Emacs. While going
      through elpy issues, I came across an interesting thread, where someone asked this<br>
      <br>

      </div>This lead to this post. This post gives a brief introduction on getting familiar with any Emacs package &amp; start hacking it quickly.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h3 id="getting-started-">Getting Started:</h3>
      Most Emacs packages provide a Readme file &amp; some of them have good documentation too. Also there is
      emacswiki where some other hacks will be available.<br>
      <br>
      That will be help You to get started with any package. You can start using default functions/key bindings.<br>
      <br>
      If we take elpy as a case study, it has <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/blob/master/README.rst" target="_blank">Readme file</a> which
      shows how to install elpy. It also has a <a href="http://elpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">good documentation</a> about elpy
      &amp; some of its important features.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h3 id="getting-under-the-hood-">Getting Under The Hood:</h3>

      Now lets see some interesting stuff which Emacs packages are capable of but read me file or
      documentation wont contain.<br>
      <br>
      One useful package I recommend for this purpose is <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-descbinds" target="_blank">helm-descbindings</a> which
      shows key bindings of all available modes. You can also filter among them.<br>
      <br>
      Here You will come to know about few useful functions an Emacs package is capable of doing.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of elpy, You can see something like this.<br>
      <br>

      <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
        <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k0GV9-BtdmQ/VPs3oFuqdEI/AAAAAAAANqo/sEu3kFCeDFU/s1600/elpy-emacs2.png" imageanchor="1" style=
        "clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src=
        "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k0GV9-BtdmQ/VPs3oFuqdEI/AAAAAAAANqo/sEu3kFCeDFU/s1600/elpy-emacs2.png" height="516" width="640"></a>
      </div>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <br>
      </div><br>
      But You cannot find all key bindings here as some of them might be shadowed (or taken away) by other packages.<br>
      <br>
      To specify a key binding, Emacs packages use a define-key function. So if You open source code of the package and search for define-key, you will see all
      key bindings there.<br>
      <br>
      If you search for define-key in elpy.el You will come across this<br>
      <br>

      <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
        <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbACCkJmxIg/VPs6x97q2XI/AAAAAAAANq0/1Aa_TIcbjU0/s1600/elpy-emacs21.png" imageanchor="1" style=
        "margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src=
        "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbACCkJmxIg/VPs6x97q2XI/AAAAAAAANq0/1Aa_TIcbjU0/s1600/elpy-emacs21.png" height="640" width="632"></a>
      </div>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <br>
      </div>Now You know a few functions &amp; their key bindings which are not present in the documentation.<br>
      <br>
      If there are any key bindings that are not useful You can unbind them.<br>
      For example elpy has "C-c C-p" binded to (elpy-flymake-previous-error) which I won't use much. So I can unbind it<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>    (<span class="hljs-keyword">define-key</span> elpy-mode-map <span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">kbd</span> <span class=
"hljs-string">"C-c C-p"</span>)</span> <span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>)</code>
</pre>

This sets "C-c C-p" to nil.

<h3 id="digging-deeper-">Digging Deeper:</h3>

So far we have seen what an Emacs package is capable of doing. Now, lets start tweaking it a little bit.<br>
      <br>
      The first thing You can do is start using interactive functions right away. Functions in Emacs package which has interactive form are callable commands.
      You can invoke them using M-x and function name. You will find a lot of them here.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to find all interactive commands in an emacs package, You have to search through source code &amp; find them. Instead if you have <a href=
      "https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm" target="_blank">helm</a> (If You are not using Helm, I highly recommend You to start using it.) installed, if you
      type M-x &amp; few letters of the package name, it will narrow down all the interactive functions of that package.<br>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <br>
      </div>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        Elpy has a lot of interactive commands, You can see a few of them here.
      </div>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <br>
      </div>

      <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
        <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QomW6hrTdnw/VPs8T7ifL1I/AAAAAAAANrA/XjSc8-zJRDI/s1600/elpy-emacs.png" imageanchor="1" style=

      </div>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <br>
      </div><br>
      Now You can start bindings keys to any of the functions that You like. Previously We have unbinded a key. Now lets bind it to some function.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-p") 'elpy-set-project-root)<br>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div><br>

      <h3 id="digging-deeper-">Getting (in)sane With Lisp:</h3>

      <div>
        So far we have just used Emacs package as it is. If You know a bit of lisp, You can start tweaking existing functions or You can write Your own
        functions. This mostly depends on how You want to use &amp; customize a package. You can do a lot of fun stuff. Enjoy lisping :)
