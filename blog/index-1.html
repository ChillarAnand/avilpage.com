            So, You have a slow internet connection and You want to watch your favorite videos without buffering? Here is the trick. One thing you can do immediately
            increase buffering speed is to reduce the quality of the video.<br><br>
            The other thing you can do is to reduce the information on the page other than video. To do this, you can go to the bottom of the page and click on " Try
            something new "  In the next page you will find " Youtube feather " If you opt in for the Youtube feather, you can watch videos without buffering even
            with a slow internet connection. However the comments under the video and some other features will be missing!<br><br>
            Watch the video to know how to do that!<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Google Helpouts - What Are They? </h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">When I heard about helpouts, I don't understand what helpouts are exactly. Google helpouts is helping the people to help each other.   For more read the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-helpouts-help-when-you-need.html" target="_blank">official announce of helpouts on Google blog</a>.</div>
<h2>Invitation Code</h2>
<div>If you are good at something and want to help ( for free or for a fee ) you need an invitation code. I also want to offer some helpouts. So, I requested for a code and I didn't received any for a few days. So I contacted support for help. They said, providing helpouts are limited to english speaking counries   U.S., Canada, Ireland, U.K., Australia and New Zealand. I am from India. So, there is no chance for me. Here is a snapshot of reply from Google Helpouts support!</div>
