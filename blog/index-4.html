        <hr>
<div class="e-content">
        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">If you are a (Telugu) book worm and you are living out of Andhra, then getting Telugu books is a huge problem. Thankfully a lot of online stores are coming forward to solve this problem. Lets look at a few sites where we can get Telugu print &amp; e-books.<br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">1. <a href="http://www.dli.gov.in/" target="_blank">Digital Library of India</a>: [Free]</h3>
<div>Government of India is spending a crazy amounts of money to digitize public domain books. This is the best place to get telugu ebooks for free of cost. Currently there are 23,370 books in Telugu. Eventhough you won't new books there, you can find a lot of great classics.</div>
<div><br></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. <a href="http://kinige.com/" target="_blank">Kinige</a>:</h3>
<div>This is the most popular site(Alexa Traffic Rank: 118,798) for buying Telugu books online. They supply both print books &amp; e-books. The good thing about Kinige is they rent the for a period of 30 days at a reduced price. Most books are available here and is a good place to get started.</div>
<div><div><br></div></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. <a href="http://www.logili.com/" target="_blank">Logili</a>: </h3>
<div>One more popular (Alexa Traffic Rank: 138,459) website to buy books online. It's also has great collection. However they sell only print books but no e-books. At times when there are no print books on Kinige, this is a great alternative.</div>
<div><br></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">4. <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>:</h3>
<div>Most of you heard of Flipkart. You can't get all telugu books here but a few. If you are a regular shopper at flipkart, you might get available books at discount price.</div>
<div><br></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">5. <a href="http://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>:</h3>
<div>It is struggling &amp; competing with other online stores in India. Here also you can find a reasonable number of telugu books are great discounts.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>You can also buy telugu books at <a href="http://www.supatha.in/index.php/" target="_blank">Supatha</a>, <a href="http://www.booksforyou.co.in/Language/Telugu" target="_blank">BooksForYou</a>, <a href="http://www.infibeam.com/Books/telugu-books-showcase.html" target="_blank">InfiBeam</a>, <a href="http://www.eveninghour.com/telugubooks.php" target="_blank">EveningHour</a>.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In addition to these sites, authors or publication houses might be running their own sites ( for example <a href="http://www.yandamoori.com/" target="_blank">Yandamoori</a> sells his books from his site also ), you can buy from them also.</div>
<div>
<br><br><b>Update:</b><br><b><br></b><b><a href="http://www.avkf.org/" target="_blank">AVKF:</a></b><br>Recently I came across AVKF. It also has a great collection of telugu books.<br><br><br>

The boat had several large, fresh fish in it.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-size: 12.7273px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.92px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: white; color: #666666; display: inline !important; float: none; font-size: 12.727272033691406px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.920001983642578px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">The investment banker was impressed by the quality of the fish and asked the Mexican how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied, “Only a little while.” The banker then asked why he didn’t stay out longer and catch more fish?</span></span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-size: 12.7273px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.92px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: white; color: #666666; display: inline !important; float: none; font-size: 12.727272033691406px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.920001983642578px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">The Mexican fisherman replied he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-size: 12.7273px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.92px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: white; color: #666666; display: inline !important; float: none; font-size: 12.727272033691406px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.920001983642578px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">The American then asked “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”</span></span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: white; color: #666666; display: inline !important; float: none; font-size: 12.727272033691406px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.920001983642578px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">The Mexican fisherman replied, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos: I have a full and busy life, senor.”</span></span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: white; color: #666666; display: inline !important; float: none; font-size: 12.727272033691406px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.920001983642578px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">The investment banker scoffed, “I am an Ivy League MBA, and I could help you. You could spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat, and with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats until eventually you would have a whole fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to the middleman you could sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery.

He panicked, and headed over to his friend's place with his pen-drive. He copied the "Recycle Bin" icon from his computer into the pen-drive, came back to his room and copied back the "Recycle Bin" icon onto his laptop's desktop.

<div><br></div>Before coming to IIT, I wanted to be an scientist. After spending 2 fruitful years, my life has undergone radical transformation. Now i dream of becoming a porn star. i feel its the most satisfying job in the world. For the past 60 years, IIT have grossly neglected the porn industry, as a result, the industry has not developed to its full potential.I want to be a pioneer and introduce some path-breaking changes.<br><br>We were the ones who created Kamasutra and yet we don't have indigenous websites which can challenge the mighty "naughty america". From my months of research on desi videos, i have found that indians don't show grace and elegance in bed. I need to change these doggy habits.<br><br>Before it becomes to too late, i need to revive the aesthetic sense of people. But I don\'t know how to tell my parents ( Papa,i will be earning less but i will be happy and i will never complain about it.) Social taboo associated with the job is my biggest obstacle. Despite living in an enlightened age, we don't give respect and dignity to porn-stars.<br><br>Saala Dekhte sab hai par koi acknowledge nahi karta..#IITB-CSE(PG)<br><br><br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Indian Confessions #3</h3>
<div><br></div>I'm watching my favorite show (Koffee With Karan ;)) on TV, when the phone rings.<br><br>There's a agitated lady on the phone.<br><br>Lady: "Hello? BSNL? My phone has not been working for...."<br>Me (interrupting) : "I think you have the wrong number"<br>Lady: "Oh! I'm sorry..."<br><br>and I hang up the phone. 3 seconds later, it rings again. It's the same lady.<br><br>Lady: "Hello? BSNL? My phone is not working..."<br>Me: "Ma'am, the number you are dialing is the wrong number!", and hang up the phone.<br><br>I return to the TV show. It's a juicy episode with Rakhee Savant, and she's bitching about Kareena. And the phone rings again.<br><br>Lady:  "Hello? BSNL? Listen, don't play games with me, OK? I know this is the  right number. Don't try to avoid me. Do you know who I am?"<br><br>I realized that this lady was not going to let me watch the show unless someone listened to her complaint.<br><br>Me: "Welcome to BSNL's automated fault booking service. To continue in English, press one."<br><br>beep<br><br>The lady had actually pressed the '1' on her dial pad. Interesting. I thought I'd have some fun.<br><br>Me: "To register a complaint, please press the last 5 digits of your Driving License number after the beep. BEEP"<br><br>I can hear the lady furiously rummaging through her bag looking for her Driving License. After a while<br><br>beep-beep-beep-beep-beep<br><br>She had actually found it pretty fast.<br><br>Me:  "Because of all the SPAM we have been receiving, we will now perform a  check to see if you are human. Please enter the result of 35 multiplied  by 4 divided by 12"<br><br>I can hear the lady shouting out to someone in the background.<br><br>Lady: "Prakash, quick! What is 35 times 4 by 12?"<br>Prakash: "What? Why do you need that?"<br>Lady: "I'm registering a complaint for our dead phone"<br>Prakash (sounding somewhat confused): "But why would you need..."<br>Lady: "JUST ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION"<br>Prakash: "err..it's...aaaa...elevent point....errr..."<br><br>beep-beep<br><br>The lady actually enters 1-1 on the dial pad.<br><br>Me: "Your complaint has been registered. Thank you for calling BSNL"<br><br>The lady sounds pleased. I can hear her speaking to "Prakash"<br><br>Lady:  "I like BSNL. They have such a high tech system. They didn't even have  to ask me for the number of our landline that is dead. Cool!<br><br><br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Indian Confessions #4</h3>
<br>My best friend always used to be in a financial crisis as he got minimal amount of money to spend for one month. He wholeheartedly rejected every single time I tried to offer him some cash. Once he had a very bad ligament tear during a football match and ran out of money in the hospital. He called his sister and asked for 1500 Rs to pay his debts which unluckily got stolen the next day from his room.<br><br>He was so tensed that he cried like a baby. It really hurt me. Next day, when he was out of his room, I managed to enter his room and quietly kept the same amount in the drawer of his study table. He couldn't believe it. But it really felt great to see him smile.<br><br>This was 2 years ago and now both of us are working in the same finance company. One morning, I found an envelope with a dairy milk chocolate on my table. I opened it. There was a cheque of 1500 Rs. signed by him with a note that said, "Thank you Brother. You mean a lot to me !<br><br><br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Indian Confessions #5</h3>
<br>Must read this post... you will end up laughing..<br>This can happen only in Mumbai... no where else.. Read on..<br><br>Only local train passengers in Mumbai will know how helpful other commuters in trains try to be. Last week, a hapless victim fell prey to the over-enthusiastic Mumbai's Local train commuter.<br><br>Our hero, a man from Pune, wanted to go to Matunga, but as luck and trains would have it, boarded a fast train not halting at his destination. He panicked on realizing his mistake but by then the local had started moving. On seeing his plight, a sympathetic co-passenger decided to come to his rescue.<br><br>It seemed that he had been commuting by that particular train for past 6 years and had noticed that the train always slowed just before Matunga station and crawled at a snail's pace while passing through it. He told the man to jump out of the running train as it slowed down and that with a little bit of fleet-footedness, he would make it safely on terra firma.<br><br>However, knowing the man's inexperience, he added some words of caution : "Keep running the moment you jump or you will fall. Just keep running." He stressed the word "running" lest the man not know the laws of motion.<br><br>The train slowed down just before Matunga Station and at the prompting of his mentor, our hero jumped out of the train and started running as if all hell had broken loose.<br><br>What he didn't realize, of course, was that he was running parallel to the train instead of running away from it. Meanwhile, the train slowed down further, so that the man was running faster than the train. In the process, he reached the door of the next compartment and the foot board commuters there pulled him in thinking he was trying to board the train.<br><br>To this agony, the train picked up speed and sped past Matunga and his new co-passengers started to congratulate him on how lucky he had been, until he told them that they had actually undone what he had done with great difficulty.<br><br>Those standing at the door of his "ex-compartment" had witnessed the whole drama and just couldn't stop laughing at the poor man's situation, while he grinned sheepishly...!!!! <br><br><br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Indian Confessions #6</h3>
<br>"I was a backlogger with absolutely no interest in studies. I stayed in IITB for almost 8 years suffering the arrogance of moronic profs... at the same time I was consistently ranked in the world's top 20 bridge players, and the top 5 scrabble players in India. In those days I routinely raked in Rs 30k a month (in those days it was worth 2x-3x today's rate) just participating and winning various inter-college lit fests &amp; local bridge tournaments.<br><br>I also wrote IIM-CAT for 6 straight years and got calls from all 6 IIMs which I had to turn down because of the backlogs. I realized I don't need this degree or this education... today I am a well known worldwide highly ranked scrabble and bridge player. I earn 7 figures and don't have to brush, shave, wear a suit or do anything useful in general.

<br>"Yesterday, while travelling by metro i was a silent spectator to this very hilarious incident.<br><br>A very well dressed pretty northeastern girl boarded at Central Secretariat and sat right beside me, some group of behenji's(prejudiced women) flocked around her, making all indecent comments, i was annoyed but i waited to see if anything interesting would happen. Those behenji's then, in pathetic English asked her,<br><br> where are you from?<br><br> She smiled and said 'Nagaland'...<br><br>The girls, talking among themselves..<br><br>*'yeh to Phoren se hai yaar', 'uski choti choti ankhon ko dekho', 'India me kya kaam hai', 'woh wali business hogi'...<br><br>(*Translation - "She is from foreign", "Look at her tiny tiny eyes" "What is her work in India", "She must be in that kinda business")<br><br>The whole journey was filled with insults from these girls, but she never paid heed, if i were her i would have taught these girls a good lesson, i wondered if she didn't understand Hindi...<br><br>To my amazement, she took out a notebook and pen from her bag, and wrote in perfect Hindi..<br><br> 'nagaland bhi India mein hi hain, map kharid ke do kya?',<br><br>(Translation - Nagaland is also in India, Should i purchase a map and give it to you)<br><br>handed it over to the girls with a warm smile and got off at vishwavidyalaya. I couldn't stop laughing and admiring the girl for her patience and wit.<br><br><br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Indian Confessions #9</h3>
<br>I read this on the page 18+ Confessions. Definitely ROFL material.. and the comments on the posts are something to Laugh out loud for.<br><br>During lunch at work last week, I ate 3 plates of beans (which I know I shouldn't). When I got home, my b.f seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly: "Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight." He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my b.f was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence, when my b.f returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused: "Happy Birthday"..<br><br><br>Credit: <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Indian-confession-you-have-ever-read-on-a-Facebook-page" target="_blank">What is the best Indian confession you have ever read on a Facebook page? </a>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Osho is a great story teller. Whether he is writing a book, preaching his students, giving speeches, he tells interesting short stories. I have read a lot of them from his books. This is one of my favorite stories.</span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Osho I used present tense above because Osho believes that he is '</span><quote>Never Born, Never Died.

<div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There was an ancient mysterious wall which stood at the edge of a village, and whenever anyone climbed the wall to look onto the other side, instead of coming back he or she smiled and would jump to the other side, never to return. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The inhabitants of the village became curious as to what could draw these people to the other side of the wall. After all, their village had all the necessities of living a comfortable life.They made an arrangement to where they would tie a person's feet, so that when he or she looked over and wished to jump, they could be pulled back.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The next time someone tried to climb the wall to see what was on the other side, they chained her feet so that she could not go over. She looked on the other side and was delighted at what she saw, and smiled.Those standing below grew curious to question her and pulled her back, but to their great disappointment she had lost the power of speech.</span></div>
