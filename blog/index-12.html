<p>Today I have attended AIAI summit 2017 in Bangalore. Amazon started this summit to network with academia, industry data scientists and showcase amazon's work in machine learning.</p>
<p>There were 4 talks and 20 poster presentations. Most of them were scholars from IITB, IITM, IISC, IITH, one talk by CMU professor and remaining talks by Amazon.</p>
<p align="center">

<p>Amazon team talked about the problems they are solving with machine learning like auto correcting address, suggesting right size for shoes/apparel, answering questions on products e.t.c.</p>
<p>People from academia talked about the research work they are doing and their results.</p>
<p>I have been working on Telugu OCR in the past few months. There were 3 poster presentations regarding indic languages. Even though a lot of papers were published in the past, there is no end-to-end OCR with good accuracy (&gt;98%) for Indic languages. It is good to see Indic languages getting traction in deep learning.</p>

<p>To program Arduino, we can use <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino IDE</a> which facilitates writing and uploading code to the board.</p>
<p>If we are using a text editor for programming, it will have lot of customisations which speed up development process. In such case, it is better to use same text editor for arduino programming too.</p>
<p>I use Emacs as IDE and there is <a href="https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode">arduino mode</a> for emacs which provides syntax highlighting and some useful utilites to write arduino code. We can find such packages for other editors also.</p>
<p>Arduino also provides cli interface to upload code to arduino. To upload code, we need to specify port, board and the code to upload.</p>
<p>In Linux system, to upload a file called <code>foo.ino</code>, we can run</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>arduino --port /dev/ttyACM0 --board arduino:avr:mega
 <span class="se">\ </span>--upload foo.ino
</pre>


<p>An alternate way is to use <a href="https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/">platformio</a>, an opensource tool chain for IoT development.</p>
<p>It can be installed using pip.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>pip install platformio
</pre>


<p>Once it is installed, code can be directly uploaded using <code>ci</code> command.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>pio ci --board<span class="o">=</span>megaatmega2560 --project-option<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"upload_port=/dev/ttyACM0"</span> --project-option<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"targets=upload"</span> foo.ino
</pre>


<p>By this we can use text editor to write code and arduino/platformio to upload code to arduino board.</p>

<p>Most Indian languages have strong consonant-vowel structure which combine to give syllables. These syllables are written as one continuous ligature and they require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_text_layout">complex text rendering</a> (CTL) for type setting.</p>
<p>Writing OCR (Optical Character Recognistion) software for CTL scripts is a challenging task as segmentation is hard. Because of this overall accuracy drops drastically.</p>
<p>A better approach is to use <a href="ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/icml2006.pdf">Connectionist Temporal Classification</a> (CTC) which can identify unsegmented sequence directly as it has one-to-one correspondence between input samples and output labels.</p>
<p>Here is a sample input and output of a <a href="https://github.com/rakeshvar/rnn_ctc">RNN-CTC</a> network which takes an unsegmented sequence and outputs labels.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/ctc.png"></p>

<p>Open source OCR software <a href="https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy/">ocorpy</a> uses BLSTM-CTC for text recognistion. <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a> started using the same in its latest(4.0) version.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/ChillarAnand/likitham">trained a model</a> to recognize Telugu script using ocropy and the accuracy is ~99% which is far better when compared to OCR softwares without CTC which are accurate to ~70%.</p>
