    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>When a company plans to build a mobile application and/or a web application, they need to create REST APIs to store data. This is a common requirement for CRUD applications.</p>
<p>In the Python ecosystem, there are several projects like Django Rest Framework, Flask-RESTful, FastApi which does the heavy lifting of implementing REST APIs. In other ecosystems, there are similar projects/frameworks for this job.</p>
<h4>REST API Generators</h4>
<p>By using the above mentioned frameworks, developers can build REST APIs at a faster rate. Still, developers have to develop and maintain code for these APIs.</p>
<p>To avoid even this work, there are REST API generators like postgrest<sup id="fnref:postgrest"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2022/04/frappe-framework-rest-api-generator.html#fn:postgrest">1</a></sup>, prest which can instantly generate REST APIs by inspecting database schema. With these, developers just have to design the DB schema and these tools take care of generating APIs without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>In this post, let us see how Frappe framework can be used as a REST API generator and what are the advantages of using Frappe.</p>
<h4>Frappe Framework</h4>
<p>Frappe framework is meta data driven low code, web framework written in Python and Javascript.</p>
<h5>Web UI</h5>
<p>Frappe framework provides web UI to create models(called doctypes in Frappe) and it provides REST API<sup id="fnref:rest_api"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2022/04/frappe-framework-rest-api-generator.html#fn:rest_api">2</a></sup> for all the models out of the box.</p>
<p>There is no need to write manual SQL queries to manage schema. With some training even non-developers can even manage models in Frappe.</p>
<h5>Roles &amp; Permissions</h5>
<p>With traditional API generators, managing roles &amp; permissions involves additional development and maintenance costs. Frappes comes with an authentication system and it has support for role based permissions out of the box. From the web UI, users can manage roles &amp; permissions.</p>
<h5>Hooks</h5>
<p>Even though REST API generators give API out of the box, there will be scenarios where custom business logic needs to be hooked in for various events.
In such scenarios, developers end up using an alternate framework/tool to manage hooks and business logic.</p>
<p>Frappe provides server scripts by which arbitrary python code can be executed dynamically based on model events. There is no need to set up another framework for these things.</p>
<h5>Utilities</h5>
<p>Frappe framework comes with a lot of utilities like Job Queues, Schedulers, Admin interface, socket.io etc. As the project grows and the need evolves, Frappe has all the common utilities that are required for a web application development.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>When a company wants to build a solution to a problem, it should focus most of the time in solving that problem instead of wasting their time on building CRUD interfaces or REST APIs.</p>
<p>Frappe framework was designed to rapidly build web applications with low code. If you need a REST API generator and some additional functionality for the REST APIs, Frappe framework fits the bill and reduces a lot of development time.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>As software developers, we use fuzzy search a lot especially when using Emacs or any other editors/IDEs. For example to search a file called <code>patient_history.js</code>, in the editor, we can just type <code>pah</code> and editor will narrow it down.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-1.png"></p>
<p>This is quite handy as we can open any file with just few characters.</p>
<p>FF is a low code, open source, web framework in Python and Javascript. All sites built with FF will have a global search bar(aka awesome bar) as shown below. Here, we can search for doctypes, reports, pages etc.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-2.png"></p>
<p>To open <code>Patient History</code>, we have to type almost the entire text in search bar. If we type <code>pah</code> like we have typed in the editor, it won't show any results.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-3.png"></p>
<p>Instead, we can add fuzzy search here so that we can search for any item with just a frew key strokes.</p>
<h4>Fuzzy Search</h4>
<p>There are many third party packages which implement fuzzy search in programming languages. However we can't use any of these fuzzy search packages directly. These editors internally use a scoring algorithm to rank the results and display results based on score.</p>
<p>It internally considers many factors mentioned below for scoring.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matched letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CamelCase letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>snake_case letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consecutive matching letters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can come up with a scoring mechanism for these factors and based on the matches, we can rank the results. I have implemented a custom fuzzy search alogirthm based on the above factors but it was slow and results were not good in some cases.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled up this <a href="https://github.com/forrestthewoods/lib_fts/blob/master/code/fts_fuzzy_match.js">fts_fuzzy_match</a> implementation. This is a reverse engineered implementation of sublime text fuzzy search and it has a detailed scoring mechanism as well. It assigns negative ranking to mismatched letters and bonus points for consecutive matches.</p>
<p>This works well and is as effective as most IDEs search. Now that there is a solid fuzzy search, all we need to do is hook this up in FF.</p>
<p>FF internally has a fuzzy search function and we can directly hook it up here as shown here.</p>
<p>After that, we can search for anything in just few key strokes. For example to open patient history, we can just type <code>pah</code> and it will show results like this.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-4.png"></p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Fuzzy search in editors/IDEs is quite handy and when we bring to other places like FF or any other search bar, it improves search experience a lot.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In healthcare orgainsations, data exchange between systems is complicated and has interopolabilty issues. Integration engines are widely used in healthcare industry for bi-directional data transfer.</p>
<p>In this article, let us look at the advantages of using interface engines and how Frappe Framework can be used as an interface engine.</p>
<h4>Integration Engines</h4>
<p>In a traditional agile development approach, building a new interface might take weeks/months. With an integration engine, a new interface can be replicated in a matter of hours with little or no scripting at all.</p>
<p>Creating a REST API, listening to a webhook, transforming a data between channels, broadcasting a message, sending/receiving HL7 messages or any other commonly performed task can be implemented in integration engine without much effort.</p>
<p>Due to this integration engines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirth_Connect">Mirth Connect</a> are widely used in healthcare.</p>
<p><img src="../images/mirth-integration-engine.png"></p>
<p>The above diagram shows usage of integration engine in a healthcare orgainsation.</p>
<h4>Frappe Framework</h4>
<p>Frappe Framework is a low code web application framework with batteries included. Even though Frappe is lablled as a framework, it can be used as an integration engine as well.</p>
<p>It provides REST APIs out of the box for all the models(called doctypes in Frappe). Users can create custom APIs using <a href="https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/api/rest">server scripts</a> and it has support for webhooks as well.</p>
<p>Users can schedule custom cron jobs, setup emails, enable data transformations and other tasks without much coding.</p>
<p>One feature Frappe Framework lacks when compared to integration engines is sending/receiving HL7 messages on ad-hoc ports. This feature is not available out of the box. Users need to develop a custom app or use any 3rd party app for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/frappe/healthcare">Frappe Healthcare</a> is an HIS(Healthcare Information System) built on top of Frappe/ERPNext. If a hospital is using Frappe Healthcare, then there won't be a need to use integration engine as Frappe framework can take care of most of these things.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-his.png"></p>
<p>The above diagram shows usage of Frappe Healthcare as HIS in a healthcare orgainsation.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In healthcare, integration engines are used extensively to tackle data exchange between systems. Due to its low-code development and batteries included approach, even though Frappe is a web application framework, it can be used as an integration engine as well.</p>

<p>In 2018, I decided to write at least one blog post per month throughout the year. Even though I tried to write posts every month, I couldn't publish anything in few months.</p>
<p>In 2019, I went a step ahead and made a legal(?) agreement with a friend. I paid him 1,00,000 rupees and told him that he could keep the money as a reward if I failed to write a blog post every month.</p>
<p>This agreement kept me on my toes. I didn't miss writing a single month in 2019. I stayed awake on the last days of the month to finish and publish the post before midnight.</p>
<p>In 2020, I took up the challenge again and I was able to write at least one post every month.</p>
<p>In 2021, I didn't take up the challenge. I wrote just three posts in the entire year.</p>
<p>In the two years when I took the challenge, even though I wrote a few mediocre articles, I wrote a few good articles. In the other two years when I didn't take the challenge, my writing quality and quantity declined.</p>
<p>Due to this, I decided to take up the writing challenge again this year.</p>
<p>Instead of limiting the 1,00,000 reward to my friend, I decided to extend it to all the readers.</p>
<p>The first person who calls out that there is no new blog post in a month will get the 1,00,000 reward. The next three people will get a small gift as a token of appreciation.</p>
<p>I will try my best to write at least one post every month. Let's wait till the end of the year and see how it goes.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>On a lazy evening, while on a call with a friend, I made a typo while entering the url. Instead of typing <a href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html">http://app-00421.on-aptible.com</a>, I typed <a href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html">http://app-00412.on-aptible.com</a><sup id="fnref:aptible"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html#fn:aptible">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this article, lets see how this typing mistake got me a bug bounty.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability</h4>
<p>A <a href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html">bug bounty program</a><sup id="fnref:bb"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html#fn:bb">2</a></sup> is a deal offered by companies by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, security exploits and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Aptible provides HIPAA<sup id="fnref:hipaa"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html#fn:hipaa">3</a></sup> compliant PAAS platform so that healthcare companies can deploy their apps without compliance hassle.</p>
<p>After deploying an application on aptible, users can create an endpoint for public access. For this purpose, atpible generates domain names in sequential order.</p>
<p>Due to this, a set of publicly exposed servers will have incremental domain names. A lot of companies use these sequentially generated domain names for staging &amp; testing purposes. In general, many companies don't bother about implementing security best practices on non-production servers.</p>
<p>When I was trying to access a demo site at <a href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html">http://app-00421.on-aptible.com</a>, I made a typo and visited <a href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html">http://app-00412.on-aptible.com</a>. This site was a staging site of some other company without any authentication. The company's source code, AWS keys and a lot of sensitive information was publicly accessible.</p>
<p>I quickly sent an email to that company regarding this issue and they took their site offline. As per <a href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html">Aptible disclosure policy</a><sup id="fnref:disclosure"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2021/10/typo-lead-to-bug-bounty.html#fn:disclosure">4</a></sup>, this bug is out of scope. However I sent an email to their team regarding the severity of the issue. Since sequential domain names are generating additional target surface for attackers, I suggested to move to random urls.</p>
<p>For this disclosure, they have provided a bounty of 100$ and Aptible decided to move away from sequential domain names.</p>

    <p>This is a series of <a href="../tags/dicom.html">articles on mastering Dicom</a>. In the earlier article, we have learnt how PACS/DICOM simplifies the clinical work flow.</p>
<p>In this article, lets setup a dicom server so that we have a server to play around with Dicom files.</p>
<h4>Orthanc Server</h4>
<p>There are several Dicom servers like Orthanc, Dicoogle etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthanc_(server)">Orthanc</a> is a lightweight open source dicom server and is widely used by many Health care organisations.</p>
<p>Sébastien Jodogne, original author of Orthanc maintains docker images. We can use these images to run Orthanc server locally.</p>
<p>Ensure docker is installed on the machine and then run the following command to start Orthanc server.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ docker run -p <span class="m">4242</span>:4242 -p <span class="m">8042</span>:8042 --rm <span class="se">\</span>
    jodogne/orthanc-python
</pre>
<p>Once the server is started, we can visit <a href="http://localhost:8042">http://localhost:8042</a> and explore Orthanc server.</p>
<h4>Heroku Deployment</h4>
<p>Heroku is PAAS platform which supports docker deployments. Lets deploy Orthac server to Heroku for testing.</p>
<p>By default, Orthanc server runs on 8042 port as defined in the config file. Heroku dynamically assigns port for the deployed process.</p>
<p>We can write a shell script which will read port number from environment variable, replace it in Orthanc configuration file and then start Orthanc server.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="ch">#! /bin/sh</span>

<span class="nb">set</span> -x

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$PORT</span>

sed <span class="s1">'s/ : 8042/ : '</span><span class="nv">$PORT</span><span class="s1">'/g'</span> -i /etc/orthanc/orthanc.json

Orthanc /etc/orthanc/
</pre>
<p>We can use this shell script as entry point in docker as follows.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">FROM jodogne/orthanc-python

EXPOSE $PORT

WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app

ENTRYPOINT [ "./run.sh" ]
</pre>
<p>We can create a new app in heroku and we can deploy this container.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ heroku apps:create orthanc-demo

$ heroku container:push web
$ heroku container:release web
</pre>
<p>Once the deployment is completed, we can access our app from the endpoint provided by heroku. Here is a <a href="https://orthanc-demo.herokuapp.com">orthanc demo server</a> running on heroku.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In this article, we have learnt how to setup Orthanc server and deployed it to Heroku. In the next article, let dig deeper into dicom protocol by upload/accessing dicom files to the server.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Even though Test Driven Development(TDD)<sup id="fnref:tdd"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/12/minimum-viable-testing-risk-based.html#fn:tdd">1</a></sup> saves time &amp; money in the long run, there are many excuses why developers don't test the software. In this article, lets look at Minimum Viable Testing(aka Risk-Based Testing)<sup id="fnref:mvt"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/12/minimum-viable-testing-risk-based.html#fn:mvt">2</a></sup> and how it helps to achieve maximum stability with minimum effort.</p>
<h4>Minimum Viable Testing</h4>
<p>Pareto principle states that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. In software proucts, 80% of the users use 20% of the features. A bug in these 20% features is likely to cause higher impact than the rest. It makes sense to prioritize testing of these features than the rest.</p>
<p>Assessing the importance of a feature or risk of a bug depends on the product that we are testing. For example, in a project a paid feature gets more importance than free feature.</p>
<p>In TDD, we start with writing tests and then writing code. Compared to TDD, MVT consumes less time. When it comes to testing, there are unit tests, integration tests, snapshot tests, ui tests and so on.</p>
<p>When getting started with testing, it is important to have integration tests in place to make sure if something is working. Also the cost of integration tests is much cheaper compared to unit tests.</p>
<p>Most of the SAAS products have a web/mobile application and an API server to handle requests for the front end applications. Having UI tests for the applications and integration tests for APIs for the most crucial functionality should cover the ground. This will make sure any new code that is being pushed doesnt break the core functionality.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Even though RBT helps with building a test suite quicker that TDD, it should be seen as an alternate option to TDD. We should see RBT as a starting point for testing from which we can take next step towards achieving full stability for the product.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Earlier, we have seen couple of articles here on finding performance issues<sup id="fnref:perf1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/11/python-web-applications-performance-sentry.html#fn:perf1">1</a></sup> and how to go about optimizing them<sup id="fnref:perf2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/11/python-web-applications-performance-sentry.html#fn:perf2">2</a></sup>. In this article, lets see how to use Sentry Performance to find bottlenecks in Python web applications.</p>
<h4>The Pitfalls</h4>
<p>A common pitfall while identifying performance issues is to do profiling in development environment. Performance in development environment will be quite different from production environment due to difference in system requirements, database size, network latency etc.</p>
<p>In some cases, performance issues could be happening only for certain users and in specific scenarios.</p>
<p>Replicating production performance on development machine will be costly. To avoid these, we can use APM tool to monitor performance in production.</p>
<h4>Sentry Performance</h4>
<p>Sentry is widely used Open source error tracking tool. Recently, it has introduced Performance to track performance also. Sentry doesn't need any agent running on the host machine to track performance. Enabling performance monitoring is just a single line change in Sentry<sup id="fnref:sentry"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/11/python-web-applications-performance-sentry.html#fn:sentry">3</a></sup> setup.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sentry_sdk</span>


<span class="n">sentry_sdk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">dsn</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"dummy_dsn"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="c1"># Trace half the requests</span>
    <span class="n">traces_sample_rate</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>Tracing performance will have additional overhead<sup id="fnref:oh"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/11/python-web-applications-performance-sentry.html#fn:oh">4</a></sup> on the web application response time. Depending on the traffic, server capacity, acceptable overhead, we can decide what percentage of the requests we need to trace.</p>
<p>Once performance is enabled, we can head over to Sentry web application and see traces for the transactions along with operation breakdown as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/sentry0.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<p>At a glance, we can see percentage of time spent across each component which will pinpoint where the performance problem lies.</p>
<p>If the app server is taking most of the time, we can explore the spans in detail to pinpoint the exact line where it is taking most time. If database is taking most of the time, we can look out for the number of queries it is running and slowest queries to pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>Sentry also provides option to set alerts when there are performance. For example, when the response time for a duration are less than a limit for a specified duration, Sentry can alert developers via email, slack or any other integration channels.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>There are paid APM tools like New Relic, AppDynamics which requires an agent to be installed on the server. As mentioned in earlier articles, there are open source packages like django-silk to monitor performance. It will take time to set up these tools and pinpoint the issue.</p>
<p>Sentry is the only agentless APM tool<sup id="fnref:note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/11/python-web-applications-performance-sentry.html#fn:note">5</a></sup> available for Python applications. Setting up Sentry performance is quite easy and performance issues can be pinpointed without much hassle.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>When using Docker, if the build is taking time or the build image is huge, it will waste system resources as well as our time. In this article, let's see how to reduce build time as well as image size when using Docker for Python projects.</p>
<h4>Project</h4>
<p>Let us take a hello world application written in flask.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">flask</span>


<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flask</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">home</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'hello world - v1.0.0'</span>
</pre>
<p>Let's create a requirements.txt file to list out python packages required for the project.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">flask==1.1.2
pandas==1.1.2
</pre>
<p>Pandas binary wheel size is ~10MB. It is included in requirements to see how python packages affect docker image size.</p>
<p>Here is our Dockerfile to run the flask application.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">FROM python:3.7

ADD . /app

WORKDIR /app

RUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]

CMD [ "-m" "flask" "run" ]
</pre>
<p>Let's use the following commands to measure the image size &amp; build time with/without cache.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ docker build . -t flask:0.0 --pull --no-cache
<span class="o">[</span>+<span class="o">]</span> Building <span class="m">45</span>.3s <span class="o">(</span><span class="m">9</span>/9<span class="o">)</span> FINISHED

$ touch app.py  <span class="c1"># modify app.py file</span>

$ docker build . -t flask:0.1
<span class="o">[</span>+<span class="o">]</span> Building <span class="m">15</span>.3s <span class="o">(</span><span class="m">9</span>/9<span class="o">)</span> FINISHED

$ docker images <span class="p">|</span> grep flask
flask               <span class="m">0</span>.1     06d3e985f12e    <span class="m">1</span>.01GB
</pre>
<p>With the current docker, here are the results.</p>
<p><img src="../images/docker0.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<h4>1. Install requirements first</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block">FROM python:3.7

WORKDIR /app

ADD ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

RUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

ADD . /app

EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]

CMD [ "-m" "flask" "run" ]
</pre>
<p>Let us modify the docker file to install requirements first and then add code to the docker image.</p>
<p><img src="../images/docker1.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<p>Now, build without cache took almost the same time. With cache, the build is completed in a second. Since docker caches step by step, it has cached python package installation step and thereby reducing the build time.</p>
<h4>2. Disable Cache</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block">FROM python:3.7

WORKDIR /app

ADD ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

RUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache

ADD . /app

EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]

CMD [ "-m" "flask" "run" ]
</pre>
<p>By default, pip will cache the downloaded packages. Since we don't need a cache inside docker, let's disable pip cache by passing <code>--no-cache</code> argument.</p>
<p><img src="../images/docker2.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<p>This reduced the docker image size by ~20MB. In real-world projects, where there are a good number of dependencies, the overall image size will be reduced a lot.</p>
<h4>3. Use slim variant</h4>
<p>Till now, we have been using defacto Python variant. It has a large number of common debian packages. There is a slim variant that doesn't contain all these common packages<sup id="fnref:dpy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/10/python-docker-build-slim-fast.html#fn:dpy">4</a></sup>. Since we don't need all these debian packages, let's use slim variant.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">FROM python:3.7-slim

...
</pre>
<p><img src="../images/docker3.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<p>This reduced the docker image size by ~750 MB without affecting the build time.</p>
<h4>4. Build from source</h4>
<p>Python packages can be installed via wheels (.whl files) for a faster and smoother installation. We can also install them via source code. If we look at Pandas project files on PyPi<sup id="fnref:pandas"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/10/python-docker-build-slim-fast.html#fn:pandas">1</a></sup>, it provides both wheels as well as tar zip source files. Pip will prefer wheels over source code the installation process will be much smoother.</p>
<p>To reduce Docker image size, we can build from source instead of using the wheel. This will increase build time as the python package will take some time to compile while building.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
</pre>
<p><img src="../images/docker4.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<p>Here build size is reduced by ~20MB but the build has increased to 15 minutes.</p>
<h4>5. Use Alpine</h4>
<p>Earlier we have used, python slim variant the base image. However, there is Alpine variant which is much smaller than slim. One caveat with using alpine is Python wheels won't work with this image<sup id="fnref:aw"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/10/python-docker-build-slim-fast.html#fn:aw">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We have to build all packages from source. For example, packages like TensorFlow provide only wheels for installation. To install this on Alpine, we have to install from the source which will take additional effort to figure out dependencies and install.</p>
<p>Using Alpine will reduce the image size by ~70 MB but it is not recomended to use Alpine as wheels won't work with this image.</p>
<p><img src="../images/docker5.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
<p>All the docker files used in the article are available on github<sup id="fnref:gh"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../2020/10/python-docker-build-slim-fast.html#fn:gh">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>We have started with a docker build of 1.01 GB and reduced it to 0.13 GB. We have also optimized build times using the docker caching mechanism. We can use appropriate steps to optimize build for size or speed or both.</p>
