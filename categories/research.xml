Here are few more reasons for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing blog posts is lightning fast(how fast can you type?). You can just publish it with a click after writing. However with scientific papers you have to wait months to get your work published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mutability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog posts are easy to edit. If you are using a version controlled system like git, any one can easily collaborate. You can also leave comments on (most) blog posts and can have discussion with the author and/or others. Scientific papers once published are hard to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No Gatekeepers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To publish blog posts, you can setup your own blog or use services like &lt;a href="http://medium.com"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt;. There are no gatekeepers who says that you can't publish a blog post because they thinks its not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Organic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog posts tend to be casual and organic. You can crack a joke and readers will enjoy it. Scientific papers are formal. You spray some sarcasm and your paper never gets published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blogging</category><category>research</category><guid>http://www.avilpage.com/2017/01/blog_posts_are_better_than_scientific_papers/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 17:03:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
