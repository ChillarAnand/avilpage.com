So they found him a bit unearthly and even frightening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day they decided to put him to a test. A bunch of them very quietly hid in a dark corner of one of the hallways, and waited for the monk to walk by. Within moments, the old man appeared, carrying a cup of hot tea. Just as he passed by, the students all rushed out at him screaming as loud as they could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the monk showed no reaction whatsoever. He peacefully made his way to a small table at the end of the hall, gently placed the cup down, and then, leaning against the wall, cried out with shock, "Ohhhhh!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px; text-align: justify;"&gt;========================================================================&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px;"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://goto.bilkent.edu.tr/gunes/ZEN/zenstories.htm" style="background-color: white; color: #5421bb; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"&gt;Zen Stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px;"&gt;&lt;br style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.avilpage.com/2014/12/categories/zen.html" style="background-color: white; color: #5421bb; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px; text-decoration: none;"&gt;More Zen Stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>master</category><category>zen</category><category>zen stories</category><guid>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/12/zen-story-surprising-master.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2014 18:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[Zen Story] A Buddha!</title><link>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/11/zen-story-buddha.html</link><dc:creator>Chillar Anand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;In Tokyo in the Meiji era there lived two prominent teachers of opposite characteristics. One, Unsho, an instructor in Shingon, kept Buddha's precepts scrupulously. He never drank intoxicants, nor did he eat after eleven o'clock in the morning. The other teacher, Tanzan, a professor of philosophy at the Imperial University, never observed the precepts. When he felt like eating, he ate, and when he felt like sleeping in the daytime, he slept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day Unsho visited Tanzan, who was drinking wine at the time, not even a drop of which is supposed to touch the tongue of a Buddhist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hello, brother," Tanzan greeted him. "Won't you have a drink?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I never drink!" exclaimed Unsho solemnly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"One who does not drink is not even human," said Tanzan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Do you mean to call me inhuman just because I do not indulge in intoxicating liquids!" exclaimed Unsho in anger. "Then if I am not human, what am I?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A Buddha," answered Tanzan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.101zenstories.com/" target="_blank"&gt;101 Zen Stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.avilpage.com/categories/zen.html"&gt;More Zen Stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>best short stories</category><category>best short zen stories</category><category>buddha</category><category>short zen stories</category><category>zen</category><category>zen stories</category><guid>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/11/zen-story-buddha.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 18:53:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[Zen Story] Announcement!</title><link>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/11/zen-story-announcement.html</link><dc:creator>Chillar Anand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;Tanzan wrote sixty postal cards on the last day of his life, and asked an attendant to mail them.

He never quoted sutras nor indulged in scholastic dissertations. Instead, his words were spoken directly from his heart to the hearts of his listeners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His large audiences angered a priest of the Nichiren sect because the adherents had left to hear about Zen. The self-centered Nichiren priest came to the temple, determined to debate with Bankei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hey, Zen teacher!" he called out. "Wait a minute. Whoever respects you will obey what you say, but a man like myself does not respect you. Can you make me obey you?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Come up beside me and I will show you," said Bankei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proudly the priest pushed his way through the crowd to the teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bankei smiled. "Come over to my left side."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The priest obeyed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No," said Bankei, "we may talk better if you are on the right side. Step over here."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The priest proudly stepped over to the right&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"You see," observed Bankei, "you are obeying me and I think you are a very gentle person.

Chinese merchants call him Happy Chinaman or Laughing Buddha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Hotei lived in the T’ang dynasty. He had no desire to call himself a Zen master or to gather many disciples around him. Instead he walked the streets with a big sack into which he would put gifts of candy, fruit, or doughnuts. These he would give to children who gathered around him in play. He established a kindergarten of the streets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever he met a Zen devotee he would extend his hand and say: “Give me one penny.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once as he was about to play-work another Zen master happened along and inquired: “What is the significance of Zen?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hotei immediately plopped his sack down on the ground in silent answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Then,” asked the other, “what is the actualization of Zen?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At once the Happy Chinaman swung the sack over his shoulder and continued on his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.101zenstories.org/happy-chinaman/" target="_blank"&gt;101 Zen Stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>great zen stories</category><category>short zen stories</category><category>zen</category><category>zen stories</category><guid>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/11/zen-story-laughing-buddha.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 20:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>4 Delightful Short Zen Stories About Women &amp; Love!</title><link>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/03/4-delightful-short-zen-stories-about.html</link><dc:creator>Chillar Anand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Reading stories is my all time favorite hobbies. I read a lot of short stories and I am sharing a few best Zen stories I have been reading recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;1. Carrying A Woman!&lt;/h3&gt;Tanzan and Ekido were once travelling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Come on, girl," said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, he carried her over the mud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ekido did not speak again until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We monks don't do near females," he told Tanzan, "especially not young and lovely&lt;br&gt;ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I left the girl there," said Tanzan. "Are you still carrying her?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;2. If You Love, Love Openly&lt;/h3&gt;Twenty monks and one nun, who was named Eshun, were practicing meditation with a certain Zen master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eshun was very pretty even though her head was shaved and her dress plain. Several monks secretly fell in love with her. One of them wrote her a love letter, insisting upon a private meeting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eshun did not reply. The following day the master gave a lecture to the group, and when it was over, Eshun arose. Addressing the one who had written her, she said: "If you really love me so much, come and embrace me now."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;3. Too Much Love&lt;/h3&gt; An aged monk, who had lived a long and active life, was assigned a chaplain's role at an academy for girls. In discussion groups he often found that the subject of love became a central topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This comprised his warning to the young women: "Understand the danger of anything-too-much in your lives. Too much anger in combat can lead to recklessness and death. Too much ador in religious beliefs can lead to close mindedness and persecution. Too much passion in love creates dream images of the beloved - images that ultimately prove false and generate anger. To love too much is to lick honey from the point of a knife."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"But as a celebate monk," asked one young woman, "how can you know of love between a man and a woman?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Sometime, dear children," replied the old teacher, "I will tell you why I became a monk."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;4.  Change!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A Chinese emperor known for his foul temper entered the bedroom of his soon-to-be-bride, who was one of the most beautiful women in all of China. She was being made to marry him against her will, as her parents were forcing her into it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Little did the emperor know however that she had also been taught by wise sages as a child. She sat expressionless, staring at the wall. "Hello, pretty," he said to her, but she didn't respond.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I said hello to you, and you will respond when I address you, do you understand me??" he snarled. But still, she didn't reply.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Most people would have answered him by now, so despite himself he grew curious, and gruffly asked, "What is it you are thinking?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally she answered him. "Two things. One, that I do not wish to marry you because you are so callous and mean-spirited. And the other thing, is that I was wondering if you have it within your power to have a certain something changed."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"What?!" the emperor exclaimed with outrage. "You bitch! How dare you question my authority! ... But ... I admit I'm curious. Since I have it within my power to snap my fingers and whatever I command within my kingdom will be obeyed, what is it you are wondering if I could change?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Your attitude," she replied. And with that she got up and walked out of the room, leaving him in stunned silence.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>amazing zen stories</category><category>best short zen stories</category><category>delightful zen stories</category><category>must read zen stories</category><category>short zen stories</category><category>zen</category><category>zen stories</category><category>zen stories about love</category><category>zen stories about women</category><guid>http://www.avilpage.com/2014/03/4-delightful-short-zen-stories-about.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 12:57:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
