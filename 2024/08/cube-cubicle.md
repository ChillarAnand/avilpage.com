When I was in college, I was traveling to a friend's place and missed bus at midnight. The next bus was at 4 AM. While I was bored waiting for the bus, I found Rubik's Cube in a shop.

I scrambled the cube and spent the next 4 hours trying to solve the cube. I managed to solve one color. When I tried to solve the next color, the pieces in the previous layer started missing.

Even after spending a lot of time in the next 3 weeks, I couldn't solve it and gave up.

After a couple of years, when I "learnt" about the internet, I searched and found simple algorithms to solve the cube. Within a few days, I was able to solve the cube in a minute.

In the final year of college, there were placements. When I was preparing resume, I included "I can solve Rubik's Cube in a minute" in it.

During the interview, interviewer asked me if I can really solve the cube in a minute. He asked me to get my cube and show him during the lunch break. I did.
Luckily, I got hired.


Even though, I was hired for Wipro I didn't join. I went to Bangalore and started applying for start-up jobs.

I went for an interview at a web development company in Malleswaram, Bangalore. The CEO looked at my résumé, took out a cube from his desk. He handed the cube to me, showed an empty cubicle behind me and said, "If you solve the cube in a minute, that cubicle is yours."

Just by learning the cube, I was able to land a job an at an MNC and a start up as well.
