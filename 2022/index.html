            <hr>
<div class="e-content">
                        <div>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>As software developers, we use fuzzy search a lot especially when using Emacs or any other editors/IDEs. For example to search a file called <code>patient_history.js</code>, in the editor, we can just type <code>pah</code> and editor will narrow it down.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-1.png"></p>
<p>This is quite handy as we can open any file with just few characters.</p>
<p>FF is a low code, open source, web framework in Python and Javascript. All sites built with FF will have a global search bar(aka awesome bar) as shown below. Here, we can search for doctypes, reports, pages etc.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-2.png"></p>
<p>To open <code>Patient History</code>, we have to type almost the entire text in search bar. If we type <code>pah</code> like we have typed in the editor, it won't show any results.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-3.png"></p>
<p>Instead, we can add fuzzy search here so that we can search for any item with just a frew key strokes.</p>
<h4>Fuzzy Search</h4>
<p>There are many third party packages which implement fuzzy search in programming languages. However we can't use any of these fuzzy search packages directly. These editors internally use a scoring algorithm to rank the results and display results based on score.</p>
<p>It internally considers many factors mentioned below for scoring.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matched letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CamelCase letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>snake_case letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consecutive matching letters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can come up with a scoring mechanism for these factors and based on the matches, we can rank the results. I have implemented a custom fuzzy search alogirthm based on the above factors but it was slow and results were not good in some cases.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled up this <a href="https://github.com/forrestthewoods/lib_fts/blob/master/code/fts_fuzzy_match.js">fts_fuzzy_match</a> implementation. This is a reverse engineered implementation of sublime text fuzzy search and it has a detailed scoring mechanism as well. It assigns negative ranking to mismatched letters and bonus points for consecutive matches.</p>
<p>This works well and is as effective as most IDEs search. Now that there is a solid fuzzy search, all we need to do is hook this up in FF.</p>
<p>FF internally has a fuzzy search function and we can directly hook it up here <a href="https://github.com/frappe/frappe/pull/16478">as shown here</a>.</p>
<p>After that, we can search for anything in just few key strokes. For example to open patient history, we can just type <code>pah</code> and it will show results like this.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-fuzzy-search-4.png"></p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Fuzzy search in editors/IDEs is quite handy and when we bring to other places like FF or any other search bar, it improves search experience a lot.</p>

            <hr>
<div class="e-content">
                        <div>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In healthcare orgainsations, data exchange between systems is complicated and has interopolabilty issues. Integration engines are widely used in healthcare industry for bi-directional data transfer.</p>
<p>In this article, let us look at the advantages of using interface engines and how Frappe Framework can be used as an interface engine.</p>
<h4>Integration Engines</h4>
<p>In a traditional agile development approach, building a new interface might take weeks/months. With an integration engine, a new interface can be replicated in a matter of hours with little or no scripting at all.</p>
<p>Creating a REST API, listening to a webhook, transforming a data between channels, broadcasting a message, sending/receiving HL7 messages or any other commonly performed task can be implemented in integration engine without much effort.</p>
<p>Due to this integration engines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirth_Connect">Mirth Connect</a> are widely used in healthcare.</p>
<p><img src="../images/mirth-integration-engine.png"></p>
<p>The above diagram shows usage of integration engine in a healthcare orgainsation.</p>
<h4>Frappe Framework</h4>
<p>Frappe Framework is a low code web application framework with batteries included. Even though Frappe is lablled as a framework, it can be used as an integration engine as well.</p>
<p>It provides REST APIs out of the box for all the models(called doctypes in Frappe). Users can create custom APIs using <a href="https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/api/rest">server scripts</a> and it has support for webhooks as well.</p>
<p>Users can schedule custom cron jobs, setup emails, enable data transformations and other tasks without much coding.</p>
<p>One feature Frappe Framework lacks when compared to integration engines is sending/receiving HL7 messages on ad-hoc ports. This feature is not available out of the box. Users need to develop a custom app or use any 3rd party app for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/frappe/healthcare">Frappe Healthcare</a> is an HIS(Healthcare Information System) built on top of Frappe/ERPNext. If a hospital is using Frappe Healthcare, then there won't be a need to use integration engine as Frappe framework can take care of most of these things.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frappe-his.png"></p>
<p>The above diagram shows usage of Frappe Healthcare as HIS in a healthcare orgainsation.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In healthcare, integration engines are used extensively to tackle data exchange between systems. Due to its low-code development and batteries included approach, even though Frappe is a web application framework, it can be used as an integration engine as well.</p>

<p>In 2018, I decided to write at least one blog post per month throughout the year. Even though I tried to write posts every month, I couldn't publish anything in few months.</p>
<p>In 2019, I went a step ahead and made a legal(?) agreement with a friend. I paid him 1,00,000 rupees and told him that he could keep the money as a reward if I failed to write a blog post every month.</p>
<p>This agreement kept me on my toes. I didn't miss writing a single month in 2019. I stayed awake on the last days of the month to finish and publish the post before midnight.</p>
<p>In 2020, I took up the challenge again and I was able to write at least one post every month.</p>
<p>In 2021, I didn't take up the challenge. I wrote just three posts in the entire year.</p>
<p>In the two years when I took the challenge, even though I wrote a few mediocre articles, I wrote a few good articles. In the other two years when I didn't take the challenge, my writing quality and quantity declined.</p>
<p>Due to this, I decided to take up the writing challenge again this year.</p>
<p>Instead of limiting the 1,00,000 reward to my friend, I decided to extend it to all the readers.</p>
<p>The first person who calls out that there is no new blog post in a month will get the 1,00,000 reward. The next three people will get a small gift as a token of appreciation.</p>
<p>I will try my best to write at least one post every month. Let's wait till the end of the year and see how it goes.</p>
