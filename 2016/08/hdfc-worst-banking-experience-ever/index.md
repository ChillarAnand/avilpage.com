I recently opened HDFC bank account. Just like other banks, they also have web and mobile app for online banking. I got login credentials and signed into web app.

After logging in, my browser got closed accidentally. So, I reopened the browser and tried to signin.

HDFC doesn't allow me to signin. It says that the session has ended abruptly and I have to wait. If HDFC already knows that the session has ended abruptly, why don't they just kill the session and start a new session when user tries to login?

I just tried doing the same with SBI, ICICI and they are handling this type of session terminations gracefully.

So, I had to wait for ~10 minutes to login.

Since my laptop was running out of battery, I used mobile to sign in. I had to transfer money to a friend. So I went `beneficiaries` page and added account details. To confirm that beneficiary, HDFC sent OTP. To get OTP number, I minimized HDFC app, opened messages, OTP and switched back to HDFC.

To my utter disbelief, HDFC ended the session when I minimized HDFC app.

I thought that they might have auto detection of OTP. So, I tried to add beneficiary again and waited for ~10 minutes. Unfortunately they don't detect OTP.

How can a user enter OTP without going to messages?

Finally, I logged again from laptop, added beneficiary and entered OTP.

After ~40 minutes, I logged into mobile app to transfer money. Whil I was in `beneficiaries` tab, I tilted the phone and it went into landscape mode and HDFC app crashed again.

I tried this on sevral mobiles (Moto E, Moto G4, 1Plus) and whenever you tilt the phone, HDFC app crashes.

Again I couldn't login for ~10 minutes.

I uninstalled HDFC app, logged in from laptop and I tried sending money to the added beneficiary through IMPS and then I throws an error.


And now I have to go to bank and to resolve the issue.


I have sent several mails about the issues and how to solve them. It has been more than a week and none of them were resolved yet.

I always thought HDFC was a great bank and I never excepted such a crappy mobile app from them.
