### About the collection

I have been fascinated by Rubik Cube Mosaic art since I came to know about. I badly wanted to try it out and have collected ~720 rubik cubes.

There are wide variety of cubes in terms of quality. Depending on the quality, the price changes. To make a large mosaic with good quality cubes needs some capital.

I have collected medium quality cubes for now. With this cubes, making mosaics will take time.


I am looking for a good vendor to buy high quality cubes.
