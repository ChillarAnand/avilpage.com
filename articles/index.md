#### Background

I am from Gaaliveedu, Andhra Pradesh, India. I have completed B. Tech from S. V. University, Tirupati.

After that I have moved to Bangalore & started working as a software engineer.

I spend a lot of time using & promoting open source software. Most of my [personal projects](/projects.html) are open
source.
