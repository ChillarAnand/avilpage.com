Amazon started this summit to network with academia, industry data scientists and showcase amazon's work in machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 4 talks and 20 poster presentations. Most of them were scholars from IITB, IITM, IISC, IITH, one talk by CMU professor and remaining talks by Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon team talked about the problems they are solving with machine learning like auto correcting address, suggesting right size for shoes/apparel, answering questions on products e.t.c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People from academia talked about the research work they are doing and their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working on Telugu OCR in the past few months. There were 3 poster presentations regarding indic languages. Even though a lot of papers were published in the past, there is no end-to-end OCR with good accuracy (&amp;gt;98%) for Indic languages. It is good to see Indic languages getting traction in deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>artificial intelligence</category><category>bangalore</category><category>conferences</category><guid>http://www.avilpage.com/2017/09/amazon-india-artificial-intelligence-aiai-summit.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 13:51:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
