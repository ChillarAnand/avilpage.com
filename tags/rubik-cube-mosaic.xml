But by the end of conference, I have realised that organising PyCon is a very very huge task. It needs a great deal of preparation, planning up things and dedicated volunteers who are interested and patient enough to spend lots of time to run it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicholas Tollervey was keynote speaker. He came to venue on October 1st(two days before conference) and helped volunteers with some tasks. He did the same on next day too. I was wondering whether he came for key note speaking or volunteering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been talking to many people on mailing lists, github and other channels. Finally I was able to meet &amp;amp; talk with many of them in person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not able to attend all sessions but many people said this&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9VgVTNHxKdw/VhLOzxutSmI/AAAAAAAAN0U/UZO2IrVkYZI/s1600/pycon-india.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="152" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9VgVTNHxKdw/VhLOzxutSmI/AAAAAAAAN0U/UZO2IrVkYZI/s640/pycon-india.png" width="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It was good to see some of 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd year B.Tech students, who were familiar with django &amp;amp; were contributing to many upstream packages. Some students were even using Emacs as their editor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toddlers were also interested to attend PyCon&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9qfufBcoa4Y/VhLO1qsFV3I/AAAAAAAAN0c/sHYWrL7h6kc/s1600/pycon-india2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="111" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9qfufBcoa4Y/VhLO1qsFV3I/AAAAAAAAN0c/sHYWrL7h6kc/s640/pycon-india2.png" width="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have planned to make Python logo mosaic with rubik cubes. I thought it will take ~10 hours to complete it. When I got there with cubes, Vignesh U, Apoorva, Ram Mohan, Sayan Chowday and many other volunteers came forward and completed it in an hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4g9ourILjdA/VhLO3T1XwwI/AAAAAAAAN0k/BJGcFDMALiQ/s1600/rubik-cube-python.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="546" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4g9ourILjdA/VhLO3T1XwwI/AAAAAAAAN0k/BJGcFDMALiQ/s640/rubik-cube-python.png" width="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was eagerly waiting for PyCon India from past few months. PyCon India was just like a cool breeze! Ah...!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;How the hell did I forget about swag kit marathon?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day before conference, we had to prepare swag kits for participants. I don't know whose idea it was to prepare it like this, that but it was brilliant and most fun part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ejr6iqqCdhc/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ejr6iqqCdhc?feature=player_embedded" width="650"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>python</category><category>rubik cube mosaic</category><category>tech</category><guid>http://avilpage.com/2015/10/pycon-india-2015-first-pycon-experience.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2015 14:03:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
