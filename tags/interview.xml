    &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
      It happened few months back in our Sri Venkateswara University College of Engineering!&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        First our placement officer R.V.S sent a notice about the campus placement! He arranged a session to get us prepared for campus placement. Students who
        have less than 2 backlogs were allowed to placement.
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        On the day, a few officials from Wipro came to our college. We all attended pre-placement talk in our formal dress. After the talk, they separated the
        students into two batches.
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        The first batch were the toppers who have more than 80% academic score. They don't have to take the written test and have to attend the interview
        directly.
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        I had around 78% score. So, I have to take the written test. Written test consisted of Aptitude questions and English vocabulary, passage writing. I
        was qualified in written test!
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Interview:&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;First round:&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        I entered into the cell greeted the interviewer. He asked me to sit down. He spoke politely and asked a few questions casually to make me comfortable.
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Second round:&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        In this round, the interviewer asked me about the Android app I have developed. I told that it was very basic app and told him how I developed it. He spoke a lot about Andoid apps and asked me to participate in App contest help by Wipro.
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        That's it. My interview was completed. Later I went out for a walk!
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        On return one of my friend told me that I got selected!
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
