#### The Story

When I was in college, I started this blog to make notes of things I am learning. After a decade, it has grown into a collection of articles on various topics like software development, finance, & health.


With 8+ years of experience in full-stack software & hardware development, I have primarily worked on Healthcare & Finance domains.

With a keen focus on business outcomes, I identify & solve the right problems with simple solutions. 

I spend a lot of time using & promoting open source software. Most of my [personal projects](/projects.html) are open
source.
