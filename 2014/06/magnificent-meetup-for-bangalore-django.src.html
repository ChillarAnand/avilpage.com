At each &amp; every step, he first explained what he is going to do. Then he would do it and gives us time to complete the task. All organizers patiently helped in troubleshooting the errors at each and every step. </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the end we had little Q &amp; A session.</span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Overall it was a great hands on experience with great content &amp; crew! </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Looking forward for more meetups!! </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Thank You very much!!!</span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you are form Bangalore &amp; love Python, don't miss <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Django-User-Group/" target="_blank">Django</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/" target="_blank">BangPypers</a> meetup.</span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">P.S: A snap of workshop.. </span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UDPwtjlSiKc/U5QJzUGjxMI/AAAAAAAAKkM/oG2iPbokc68/s1600/django-workshop.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UDPwtjlSiKc/U5QJzUGjxMI/AAAAAAAAKkM/oG2iPbokc68/s1600/django-workshop.jpeg"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span></div><br></div></body></html>
