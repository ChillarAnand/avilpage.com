<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I was going to Dairy circle yesterday evening. Near to the bus stop  I  found  a purse. A lot of people were standing and passing by but no one noticed it. I just looked around to see if any one is searching for it. But no one was there. I checked the contents to see if any number or any information is available to call the owner of the purse.<br><br>Here are the contents of the purse:<br><br>1. Bus ticket from Chennai to Bangalore<br>2. A shop's visiting card<br>3. A hundred rupee note<br>4. An old ten rupee note<br>5. Some change.<br>6. 3 photos<br>7. A SIM card<br><br>There was number written on the purse. I tried to call that number but it was not reachable and the SIM card also not working.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zSWY_oTvJR4/VDq6vn7FWMI/AAAAAAAANQI/m04e5LDEtLU/s1600/bangalore-found-purse.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zSWY_oTvJR4/VDq6vn7FWMI/AAAAAAAANQI/m04e5LDEtLU/s1600/bangalore-found-purse.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a></div></div></body></html>
