<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I spend lots and lots of time in <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/" target="_blank">terminal</a>. Quickly I realised that one terminal is not sufficient to run multiple process. So, I started using multiple tabs just like browser. Soon I get lost in a bunch of tabs. In addition to that jumping to a specific tab required lot of key strokes.<br><br>Then I came across <a href="http://gnometerminator.blogspot.in/p/introduction.html" target="_blank">Terminator</a>, which solved my problem to some extent. It is feature filled terminal based on genome-terminal. Major advantage of using this is, I can split a window, resize them and I can save the layout in my profile.<br><br>The problem comes when I ssh into remote machine. It is a GUI tool and I cannot use in a remote machine. So now if I need 5 terminals, I have to open 5 ssh connections which is pretty bad.<br><br>Then I came across <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Screen</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/" target="_blank">Tmux</a> which are more or less similar in terms of of what they offer. Using them I can ssh into remote machines &amp; can have multiple shells inside of it. But here also I need a lot of keystrokes to jump from one terminal session to another.<br><br>Finally I came across <a href="http://byobu.co/" target="_blank">BYOBU</a>, a text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer. It just provides a lot of enhancements and intuitive keybindings for screen/tmux. Even if I am connected to several remote hosts, each having several sessions with several shells, I can jump from any shell to any other with just a few keystrokes.<br><br>Watch this cool video and you will never leave Byobu...<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/NawuGmcvKus/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/NawuGmcvKus&amp;source=uds"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed width="700" height="400" src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/NawuGmcvKus&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br></div></div></body></html>
