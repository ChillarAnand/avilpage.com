He never quoted sutras nor indulged in scholastic dissertations. Instead, his words were spoken directly from his heart to the hearts of his listeners.<br><br>His large audiences angered a priest of the Nichiren sect because the adherents had left to hear about Zen. The self-centered Nichiren priest came to the temple, determined to debate with Bankei.<br><br>"Hey, Zen teacher!" he called out. "Wait a minute. Whoever respects you will obey what you say, but a man like myself does not respect you. Can you make me obey you?"<br><br>"Come up beside me and I will show you," said Bankei.<br><br>Proudly the priest pushed his way through the crowd to the teacher.<br><br>Bankei smiled. "Come over to my left side."<br><br>The priest obeyed.<br><br>"No," said Bankei, "we may talk better if you are on the right side. Step over here."<br><br>The priest proudly stepped over to the right<br><br>"You see," observed Bankei, "you are obeying me and I think you are a very gentle person. Now sit down and listen."<br><br>========================================================================<br><br><a href="http://www.avilpage.com/search/label/zen">More Zen Stories</a></div></body></html>
