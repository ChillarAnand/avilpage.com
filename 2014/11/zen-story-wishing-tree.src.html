He stopped to rest against a tree, a magical tree that would instantly grant the wishes of anyone who came in contact with it. He realized he was thirsty and wished for a drink. Instantly a cup of cool water was in his hand. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Shocked, he looked at the water, he decided it was safe and drank it. He then realized he was</div><div style="text-align: justify;">hungry and wished he had something to eat. A meal appeared before him. "My wishes are being</div><div style="text-align: justify;">granted," he thought in disbelief. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Well, then I wish for a beautiful home of my own," he said out loud. The home appeared in the meadow before him. A huge smile crossed his face as he wished for servants to take care of the house. When they appeared he realized he had somehow been blessed with an incredible power and he wished for a beautiful, loving, intelligent woman to share his good fortune.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Wait a minute, this is ridiculous," said the man to the woman. "I'm not this lucky. This can't happen to me." As he spoke...everything disappeared. He shook his head and said, "I knew it," then walked away thinkingabout his many troubles.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">========================================================================<br><br><a href="http://www.avilpage.com/search/label/zen" style="background-color: white; color: #5421bb; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20.1599979400635px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">More Zen Stories</a></div></div></body></html>
