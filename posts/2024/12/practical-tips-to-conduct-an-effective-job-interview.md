- Introduce briefly about yourself first before asking the candidate. Tell about your overall experience, your experience at the company and your role.

It is very rare to see an interviewer introduce themselves first. But it is a good practice to do so. It helps to build rapport with the candidate and makes the interview more conversational.

- Talk briefly about the project/product that you are hiring for. High level overview, tech stack, team etc.

Again, always briefly talk about the project/product you are hiring for.
