As per 2019 [JetBrains survery], PyCharm is the most widely used(36%) IDE for Python development. Even though PyCharm comes with a lot of built-in features, there are a lot of plugins available for PyCharm and other Intellij IDEs. In this article, we will see some plugins which will boost our productivity during development.


### Ace Jump

To move caret to a particular position in the editor without mouse,
[AceJump plugin][] will be useful. It allows to quickly navigate the caret to any position in the editor.


### GitToolBox

[GitToolBox][] provides a lot of additional features like inblame support, status bar widget, commit dialog, branch name completion, etc.


### Grep Console

When running a django/flask server or any Python script which generates a lot of output, it is hard to filter specific output on console. [Grep Console][] can filter or highlight output based on specific conditions which makes it easier to debug the code.


### Highlight Bracket Pair

Instead of manually scanning where a bracket starts/ends, [Highlight Bracket Pair][] will automatically highlight the bracket pairs based on cursor position.


### Key Promoter

If you are new to PyCharm or an experienced user who is using mouse instead of key board shortcuts, [Key Promoter][] will show relevant key board shortcut when mouse is used inside IDE. This provides an easy way to learn keyboard shortcuts faster.


### Rainbow Brackets

Highlight Bracket Pair will hightlight the bracket pair around the cursor. When there are multiple bracket pairs deeply nested, [Rainbow Brackets][] will highlight matching bracket pairs with matching rainbow colors.


### Save Actions

Instead of manually optimizing imports or reformatting code when changes are made, we can use [Save Actions][] which will automatically run a set of actions on every file save.


### String Manipulation

To convert lower case letters to upper case letter, [String manipulation plugin][] will be useful. In addition to lower/upper case conversion, it also provides options to convert to cameCase, kebab-case, PascalCase etc.



These are some plugins which will boost developers productivity while writing and debugging code in PyCharm or other JetBrains IDE.
