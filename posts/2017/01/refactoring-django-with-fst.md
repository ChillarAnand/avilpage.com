Django developers decided to [drop Python 2 compatability][1]{:target="_blank"} in Django 2.0. There are serveral things that should be refactored/removed.

For example, in Python 2, programmers has to explicitly specify the class & instance when invoking `super`.

```python
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        super(Foo, self).__init__()
```

In Python 3, `super` can be invoked without arguments and it will choose right class & instance automatically.

```python
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

For this refactoring, a simple `sed` search/replace should suffice. But, there are several hacks in codebase where super calls the grandparent instead of the parent. So, `sed` won't work in such cases. Also it is very hard to refactor them manually and much harder for reviewers to review it as there are 1364 super calls in code base.

```sh
â†’ grep -rI "super(" | wc -l
   1364
```

Changes has to be scripted. I wrote a [simple script][2]{:target="_blank"} to replace super calls by class names. This worked only for 50% of the cases. It failed to capture classes which had comments on top of them, classes with decorators and nested classes.

To handle all these cases, a normal python script gets more complicated and there is no guarantee that it can handle all edge cases. So, I experimented with AST(Abstract Syntax Trees).

Python has [ast module][3]{:target="_blank"} to convert code to AST but it can't convert AST back to code. There are 3rd party packages like [astor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/astor){:target="_blank"} which can do this.


```python
# this is a comment
def foo():

   print(
    "hello world"
)
```

Converting above code to AST and then converting back gives this

```python
def foo():
    print('hello world')
```

Code to AST is a lossy transformation as they cannot preserve empty lines, comments and code formatting.

```python
ast_to_code(code_to_ast(source_code)) != source_code
```

For lossless transformation, FST(Full Syntax Trees) packages like [Baron][4]{:target="_blank"} or [RedBaron][5]{:target="_blank"} should be used.

```python
fst_to_code(code_to_fst(source_code)) == source_code
```

With RedBaron FST, just locate super calls, find nearest class node, check class name with super and replace accordingly. It took [less than 10 lines][6]{:target="_blank"} of code.

RedBaron has good documentation with relveant examples and its API is similar to BeautifulSoup. Next time when writing code that modifies code consider using RedBaron.

Thanks to [Tim Graham](https://github.com/timgraham){:target="_blank"} & [Aymeric Augustin](https://github.com/aaugustin){:target="_blank"} for [reviewing the patch](https://github.com/django/django/pull/7905/commits/d6eaf7c0183cd04b78f2a55e1d60bb7e59598310){:target="_blank"}.
