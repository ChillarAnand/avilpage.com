Titus Brown wrote a blog post on why [blog posts are better than scientific papers](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-top-ten-reasons-blog-posts.html). Here are few more reasons for that.


## Fast

Publishing blog posts is lightning fast(how fast can you type?). You can just publish it with a click after writing. However with scientific papers you have to wait months to get your work published.


## Mutability

Blog posts are easy to edit. If you are using a version controlled system like git, any one can easily collaborate. You can also leave comments on (most) blog posts and can have discussion with the author and/or others. Scientific papers once published are hard to change.


## No Gatekeepers

To publish blog posts, you can setup your own blog or use services like [medium](http://medium.com). There are no gatekeepers who says that you can't publish a blog post because they thinks its not worth it.


## Organic

Blog posts tend to be casual and organic. You can crack a joke and readers will enjoy it. Scientific papers are formal. You spray some sarcasm and your paper never gets published.
