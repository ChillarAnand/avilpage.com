But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes? How do these funds operate, and what processes are involved in managing them? 
In this post, we'll explore the behind-the-scenes operations of mutual funds.

### Structure of a Mutual Fund

In India, mutual funds have 3-tier structure consisting of the Sponsor, the Trust & the Asset Management Company (AMC). 

- The sponsor establishes the mutual fund and is responsible for its operations. 

- The trust & trustees are responsible for safeguarding investor interests, supervising the AMC's operations,
and ensuring compliance with regulations.
Custodians are appointed to hold the securities of the mutual fund and ensure their safekeeping.

- AMC is the core entity responsible for the day-to-day management of the mutual fund. 

The legal seperation of Trust & AMC ensures that the interests of investors are protected, and the fund's assets are managed independently.

All AMCs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the list is available on the [SEBI website]().

We can look at SBI MF details from AMFI to understand the structure better.
