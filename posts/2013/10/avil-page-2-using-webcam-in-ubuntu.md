.. description: How to install cheese in Ubuntu to use webcam.
-->

I started using Ubuntu recently and started exploring various features. For screen recording and few other apps, webcam is needed. 

Here I am showing how to use inbuilt webcam in Ubuntu 12.04.

Open your terminal ( Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + T ) and run the following command.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install cheese
```

Once the above command is executed, you can find the Cheese app in your application menu. It will take around 3 minutes (~ 18MB)depending on your net speed. 

We can open the app by searching "cheese".
