### FNO Segment

There are 4000+ companies[^wiki_nse] that are traded in NSE/BSE. Of these, 198 stocks are included in FNO segement[^fno]. For these stocks, Futures & Options(FNO) contracts will be available and these stocks won't have any fixed ciruit limits.


### FNO Reviews

On 11th April 2018, SEBI released a circular(SEBI/HO/MRD/DP/CIR/P/2018/67) on a framework[^circular_framework] for reviewing stocks in derivatives segement. Based on this framework, a stock has to meet the below criteria be added in FNO segement.


- The stock shall be chosen from amongst the top 500 stocks in terms of average daily market capitalization and average daily traded value in the previous six months on a rolling basis.

- The stock’s median quarter-sigma order size over the last six months, on a rolling basis, shall not be less than ₹25 Lakh.

- The market wide position limit(MWPL) in the stock shall not be less than ₹500 crore on a rolling basis.

- Average daily delivery value in the cash market shallnot be less than ₹10 crore in the previous six months on a rolling basis.


If a stock is in FNO category and fails to meet this criteria, it will be removed from FNO segment.

In 2021 alone, SEBI released 6 circulars thrugh which 32 new stocks are added in the FNO segment.


### DMART

DMART has met the above FNO criteria long back. Even after it has met the criteria, there were more than 6 reviews[^c1][^c2][^c3] and suprisingly DMART was not added to the FNO segement.

There is a long discussion on Zerodha TradingQ&A forum[^tqa] on why DMART was not added to FNO category but no one could give any explaination.

After that, I have sent an email to SEBI & NSE seeking clarification for the same. It has been more than 6 months and they haven't responded yet. I have reached out to few people in the trading community privately to get clarification on the same. But nobody I know has any clue on this.

I am still looking for an answer. If you can shed some light, please send out a message to me. I would like to have a quick chat with you regarding the same.

Hoping to solve the mystery soon.
