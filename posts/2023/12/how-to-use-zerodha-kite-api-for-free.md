### Why this method?

Zerodha provides API for the clients at a nominal fee. However, using this API is too complicated even for personal use. In this post, I will provide a simple alternative method to use Zerodha API for free and in a straight forward manner.


### Jugaad Trader

Jugaad Trader is a Python package that implements reverse engineered Zerodha Kite API. To use this package, we have to install Python, pip & then install Jugaad Trader.

```bibtex
$ pip install jugaad-trader
```
