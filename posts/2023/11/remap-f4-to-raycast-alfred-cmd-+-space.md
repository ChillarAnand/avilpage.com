On Mac keyboard, there is `F4` key which opens Spotlight[^spotlight] by default. I use Raycast[^raycast] a lot instead of Spotlight and wanted to remap `F4` to Raycast. 

There is an app called Karabiner-Elements[^karabiner-elements] which can be used to remap keys. After the app is installed, we can use this rule[^f4] called `Map F4 to cmd+space`. 

You can import the rule from the above URL directly. Once the rule is imported & enabled, `F4` will be remapped to `cmd + space` as shown in the video below.
