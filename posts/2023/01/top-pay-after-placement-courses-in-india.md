### Introduction

In India, huge number of students are graduating every year. Most of them are not able to get a job right after graduation. In order to get a job in IT industry, students need to have some technical skills.

There are thousands of institutes in India that are providing paid technical courses. Depending on the course, the fees can be anywhere between 5,000 to 5 lakhs. The percentage of students who are getting a job after doing these courses is extremely low. In addition to that quite a few students are not able to afford fees to join these courses.


### Pay After Placement Courses

To combat this problem, some institutes are providing pay after placement(PAP) courses. In these courses, students will pay the fees only after getting a job with a desired package. This is a win-win situation for both the students and the institutes. This is a far better option than paying the fees upfront and not getting a job. These courses are also called as income share agreement(ISA) courses.


Here is a list of top pay after placement courses in India for front end developers, back end developers, full stack developers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, and data engineers.
