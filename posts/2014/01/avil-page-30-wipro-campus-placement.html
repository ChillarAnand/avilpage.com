He arranged a session to get us prepared for campus placement. Students who have less than 2 backlogs were allowed to placement.</div><div><br></div><div>On the day, a few officials from Wipro came to our college. We all attended pre-placement talk in our formal dress. After the talk, they separated the students into two batches.</div><div><br></div><div>The first batch were the toppers who have more than 80% academic score. They don't have to take the written test and have to attend the interview directly.</div><div><br></div><div>I had around 78% score. So, I have to take the written test. Written test consisted of Aptitude questions and English vocabulary, passage writing. I was qualified in written test!</div><div><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Interview:</h3></div><div>Next my interview!
