        First our placement officer R.V.S sent a notice about the campus placement! He arranged a session to get us prepared for campus placement. Students who
        have less than 2 backlogs were allowed to placement.

        On the day, a few officials from Wipro came to our college. We all attended pre-placement talk in our formal dress. After the talk, they separated the
        students into two batches.

      <div>
        The first batch were the toppers who have more than 80% academic score. They don't have to take the written test and have to attend the interview
        directly.

      </div>

      <div>
        I had around 78% score. So, I have to take the written test. Written test consisted of Aptitude questions and English vocabulary, passage writing. I
        was qualified in written test!

        In this round, the interviewer asked me about the Android app I have developed. I told that it was very basic app and told him how I developed it. He spoke a lot about Andoid apps and asked me to participate in App contest help by Wipro.
