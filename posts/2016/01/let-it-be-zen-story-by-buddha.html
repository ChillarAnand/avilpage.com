        <span style="font-size: 16.8px; line-height: 20.16px;">Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. While they
        were travelling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, “I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that
        lake there.”</span>

      <div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">
        <span style="font-size: 16.8px; line-height: 20.16px;">The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed a bullock cart started
        crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy. The disciple thought, “How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink!” So he
        came back and told Buddha, “The water in there is very muddy. I don’t think it is fit to drink.”</span>

      <div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">
        <span style="font-size: 16.8px; line-height: 20.16px;">After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get
        him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had
        settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.</span>

      <div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">
        <span style="font-size: 16.8px; line-height: 20.16px;">Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, “See what you did to
        make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own – and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is
        disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen.
        It is effortless.”</span>
