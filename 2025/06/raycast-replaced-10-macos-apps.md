Since I started using Raycast, I have replaced many macOS apps with it. 
Here is a list of those apps and their Raycast equivalents.

### Espanso

Instead of using Espanso for text expansion, I now use Raycast's built-in text snippets feature.


### Hotkey

I used to use Hotkey to assign keyboard shortcuts to various actions. Now, I use Raycast's built-in hotkeys feature to achieve the same functionality.

### Fly Cut

I used to use Fly Cut for clipboard management, but now I rely on Raycast's clipboard history feature to access my clipboard items quickly.

### FinderGO

I used to use FinderGO to quickly navigate to specific folders in Finder. Now, I use Raycast's built-in file navigation feature to achieve the same functionality.

### Rectangle

To move and resize windows, I used to use Rectangle. Now, I use Raycast's built-in window management feature to achieve the same functionality.

### Textbar

Instead of using Textbar to copy TOTP for two-factor authentication, I now use Raycast's extension "One Time Password" to generate and copy TOTP codes directly.

### Caffenate

To prevent my Mac from sleeping, instead of using Caffenate, I now use Raycast's built-in "Caffeinate" command to keep my Mac awake.


### Calculator

Instead of using Python prompt for basic arithmetic calculations, I now use Raycast's built-in calculator feature to perform quick calculations.
This is super convenient and saves me from opening a separate calculator app.

### Hammer Spoon (partially)

To assign shortcuts to browser urls, shell scripts, and other actions, I used to use Hammer Spoon. 
Now, I use Raycast's built-in scripting capabilities to create custom commands and assign shortcuts to them.


### Terminal (partially)

For things like killing processes, installing packages, and running shell commands, I used to rely on Terminal.
Now, I use Raycast's built-in terminal integration to run shell commands directly from the Raycast interface.


### Conclusion

With Raycast, I have been able to streamline my workflow by replacing multiple macOS apps with its powerful features.
