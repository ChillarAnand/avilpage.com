Previously, I have seen the same requests from MakeUseOf, DuckDuckGo and a few other sites.<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I immediately whitelisted labnol. The ads on labnol are not much annoying. So I let them to be there. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I surfed the site with ads for a few days. They just catch my attention, I realize that it is an ad and I will skip it. I didn't liked them at all &amp; never clicked them. So what is the use of whitelisting a site(except if it has CPM ads)? So I again blocked the all the ads. This time I even blocked the the above request also.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">But later I began to think about this. Most bloggers &amp; webmasters are solely dependent on the online income. They have to earn their livelihood only from web! </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">However, ads are not the best way to earn money. There are a lot of other ways. Instead of asking to whitelist, ask for a donation. Offering services &amp; Selling their own products might also provide a good income.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I am a huge fan of labnol &amp; following it since 2009. I am not worried to donate a few dollars once in a while but I don't like to whitelist it!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">P.S: I am also a proud Adsense publisher. But I didn't liked the idea of making money at the cost of reader's attention and trust. So, I removed ads from this blog long back. There are a couple of ads on my other blogs. I will get rid of them too. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div></div></body></html>
