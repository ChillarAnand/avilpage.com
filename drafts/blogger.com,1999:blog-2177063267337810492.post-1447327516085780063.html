They both are fruit, but taste completely different.<br>- Stephen King<br><br>The book is a film that takes place in the mind of the reader. That's why we go to movies and say, "Oh, the book is better".<br><br>- Paulo Coelho<br><br>“Never judge the book by its movie”, by J. W. Eagan.<br><br>Movies are not scripts – movies are films; they’re not books, they’re not the theatre.– Nicolas Roeg<br><br><br>I love the movies, and when I go to see a movie that’s been made from one of my books, I know that it isn’t going to be exactly like my novel because a lot of other people have interpreted it. But I also know it has an idea that I’ll like because that idea occurred to me, and I spent a year, or a year and a half of my life working on it.– Stephen King<br><br>I wanted to write and direct movies and not be forced to adapt them from a bestselling book.– Francis Ford Coppola<br><br>If you truly love film, I think the healthiest thing to do is not read books on the subject. I prefer the glossy film magazines with their big color photos and gossip columns, or the National Enquirer. Such vulgarity is healthy and safe.– Werner Herzog<br><br>I have three kids who like Harry Potter so I was sort of aware of it. You can’t really move from it: it’s on buses, in stores, it’s everywhere. One of my kids has read the books; the other two are too small but they like the movies.– Gary Oldman<br><br><br></div></body></html>
