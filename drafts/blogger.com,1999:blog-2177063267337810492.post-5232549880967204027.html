After the recitation was over the farmer asked: "Do you think my wife will gain merit from this?"<br><br>"Not only your wife, but all sentient beings will benefit from the recitation of sutras," answered the priest.<br><br>"If you say all sentient beings will benefit," said the farmer, "my wife may be very weak and others will take advantage of her, getting the benefit she should have. So please recite sutras just for her."<br><br>The priest explained that it was the desire of a Buddhist to offer blessings and wish merit for every living being.<br><br>"That is a fine teaching," concluded the farmer, "but please make one exception. I have a neighbor who is rough and mean to me. Just exclude him from all those sentient beings."</div></body></html>
